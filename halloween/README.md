### Review

Project made consisting of an invitation to a party for Halloween programmed in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

To carry it out, a background of a gloomy landscape has been used on which you will have to click on the messages. When performing this action, we will trigger an event that will show us a moving gif along with a sound related to that image.
